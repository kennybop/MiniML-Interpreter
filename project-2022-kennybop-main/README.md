## project

This repository contains the project repository for Harvard's
CS 51 class, Abstraction and Design in Computation.

For my final project for CS51, I implemented a small subset of 
an Ocaml-like language called MiniMl including only a subset of 
constructs and limited support for types without type inference. 
I implemented three models of MiniMl using the substitution 
model (eval_s), a dynamically scoped environment model (eval_d) 
and, finally, a lexically scoped environment model as my extension (eval_l).
